### A module to analyze a machine learning model for bias.

## There is some prerequsite work users need
- Users need to determine what features are bias
- Users need to logically seperate the groups into 2 classes, an advantaged group and a disadvantaged group
- This is support for the basic model types
    - linear regression
    - logistic regression/binary classification
    - multi-class classification

## Both pre-training and post training bias is supported
- Pre training bias analyzes the raw data for inherent bias
- Post training bias analyzes the model predictions for bias

## TODO: add metrics and breakdown
